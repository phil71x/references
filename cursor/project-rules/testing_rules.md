# Testing Standards

## Test Organization

1. **Test Structure**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests
   - Performance tests
   - Security tests

2. **Test Location**
   - Test files alongside source code
   - Test directories structure
   - Test data organization
   - Fixture management

## Coverage Requirements

1. **Code Coverage**
   - Minimum coverage requirements
   - Critical path coverage
   - Edge case coverage
   - Branch coverage

2. **Test Scope**
   - Feature coverage
   - API endpoint testing
   - UI component testing
   - Database operation testing

## Testing Practices

1. **Test Design**
   - Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
   - Test isolation
   - Meaningful test names
   - Clear test documentation

2. **Test Data**
   - Test data management
   - Fixture creation
   - Mock data guidelines
   - Test environment setup

3. **Mocking Standards**
   - Mock vs. Stub usage
   - External service mocking
   - Database mocking
   - Time-dependent testing

## Quality Assurance

1. **QA Process**
   - Manual testing guidelines
   - Exploratory testing
   - User acceptance testing
   - Regression testing

2. **Bug Tracking**
   - Bug report format
   - Reproduction steps
   - Priority classification
   - Resolution tracking

## Automation

1. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Automated test runs
   - Test environment setup
   - Test result reporting
   - Failed test handling

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing
   - Stress testing
   - Endurance testing
   - Scalability testing

## Implementation

1. **Tools and Frameworks**
   - Testing frameworks
   - Assertion libraries
   - Mocking tools
   - Coverage tools

2. **Monitoring and Reporting**

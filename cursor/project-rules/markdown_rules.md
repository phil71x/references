# Markdown Rules and Standards

## Overview

This document defines the markdown standards for our repository and explains how they help test Cursor AI's rule implementation capabilities.

## Rule Configuration

Our `.markdownlint.json` configuration includes:

1. **Line Length (MD013)**
   * Maximum: 120 characters
   * Rationale: Balance between readability and efficient use of space
   * Test: Cursor AI's ability to maintain line length while generating content

2. **Duplicate Headings (MD024)**
   * Allow different nesting levels
   * Rationale: Enable similar section names at different hierarchy levels
   * Test: AI's understanding of document structure

3. **HTML Elements (MD033)**
   * Allow only `<antml>` tags
   * Rationale: Required for Cursor AI function calls while maintaining markdown purity
   * Test: AI's handling of special tags

4. **First Line (MD041)**
   * Disabled
   * Rationale: Some files may need content before the first heading
   * Test: AI's flexibility in document structure

5. **Code Block Style (MD046)**
   * Style: Consistent
   * Rationale: Maintain uniform code block formatting
   * Test: AI's consistency in code examples

6. **Emphasis Style (MD049/MD050)**
   * Style: Asterisk
   * Rationale: Standardize emphasis markers
   * Test: AI's adherence to syntax preferences

## Implementation Goals

1. **Consistency Testing**
   * Monitor how well Cursor AI follows these rules
   * Document any deviations
   * Analyze rule enforcement patterns

2. **Rule Interaction**
   * Observe how markdown rules interact with other project rules
   * Test rule priority handling
   * Document any conflicts

3. **AI Behavior Analysis**
   * Track AI's markdown formatting choices
   * Monitor self-correction patterns
   * Document learning curve

## Measurement Criteria

1. **Rule Adherence**
   * Track number of linting errors
   * Monitor error patterns
   * Document common violations

2. **AI Adaptation**
   * Note how quickly AI adapts to rules
   * Document rule understanding
   * Track improvement over time

3. **Performance Impact**
   * Measure any speed changes
   * Monitor resource usage
   * Track context handling

## Usage Guidelines

1. **For AI Assistant**
   * Follow all markdown rules consistently
   * Self-check generated content
   * Report any rule conflicts
   * Suggest rule improvements

2. **For Developers**
   * Use markdown preview to check formatting
   * Run linter before commits
   * Document any rule exceptions
   * Report rule conflicts

## Review Process

1. **Regular Audits**
   * Weekly rule effectiveness review
   * Update rules as needed
   * Document common issues
   * Track improvement patterns

2. **Documentation Updates**
   * Keep this document current
   * Add new rules as needed
   * Document rule changes
   * Update examples

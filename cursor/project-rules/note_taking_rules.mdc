## Documentation Types

1. **Experiment Notes**
   - Use `experiment-` prefix in filename
   - Document hypothesis and goals
   - Record methodology and steps
   - Track results and observations
   - Note conclusions and next steps

2. **Feature Development**
   - Use `feature-` prefix in filename
   - Requirements and specifications
   - Implementation approach
   - Technical decisions
   - Testing strategy

3. **Bug Reports and Fixes**
   - Use `fix-` prefix in filename
   - Issue description
   - Reproduction steps
   - Investigation findings
   - Solution implementation

4. **Process Documentation**
   - Use `process-` prefix in filename
   - Workflow descriptions
   - Setup procedures
   - Maintenance tasks
   - Best practices

## Note Structure

1. **Standard Sections**
   - Title and overview
   - Date and author
   - Purpose and scope
   - Content sections
   - References and links

2. **Content Organization**
   - Clear hierarchy
   - Logical flow
   - Consistent formatting

3. **Metadata**
   - Use descriptive filenames
   - Add [DRAFT] in document header when in progress (remove when complete)
   - Include categories in content
   - Track dates in the Meta section of the document

## Documentation Practices

1. **Writing Style**
   - Clear and concise
   - Technical accuracy
   - Consistent terminology
   - Active voice

2. **Formatting**
   - Markdown syntax
   - Code block usage
   - Table formatting
   - List organization

3. **Cross-Referencing**
   - Link to other notes by filename
   - Reference code files with relative paths
   - Link to external resources with full URLs
   - Mention related issues/PRs by ID

## Version Management

1. **Document History**
   - Include revision history at end of document
   - Document major changes
   - Use date-based versioning
   - Include change rationale

2. **Collaboration**
   - Review process
   - Feedback incorporation
   - Shared editing
   - Conflict resolution

## File Naming Conventions

1. **Prefixes**
   - `experiment-`: For experimentation notes
   - `feature-`: For feature development
   - `fix-`: For bug fixes and solutions
   - `process-`: For workflow and process docs
   - `cursor-`: For Cursor AI specific notes

2. **Naming Pattern**
   - Use lowercase with hyphens
   - Be specific but concise
   - Dates are tracked in document Meta sections, not filenames
   - Examples:
     * `experiment-cursor-rule-testing.md`
     * `fix-frontmatter-duplication.md`
     * `process-git-workflow.md`
     * `feature-cursor-rules-implementation.md`

## Implementation

1. **Tools Usage**
   - Markdown editors
   - Preview tools
   - Version control
   - Documentation generators

2. **Quality Control**
   - Regular reviews
   - Completeness checks
   - Link validation
   - Format verification
